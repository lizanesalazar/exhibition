							<center><p class="cell">In my collage, titled “Watching Eggs Hatch,” I used several principles of composition, including unity, contrast, and balance. My art piece connects to my poem because my poem was about being seen on social media but not heard. I conveyed this by using eggs of different colors to represent groups of people, and using the eyes to represent people being seen on social media. My poem is about race & I used eggs to represent this because when you crack open an egg it’s always the same, and I thought that that related to people well. My artwork & poem connect to the article because they are about race on social media. I thought that assonance, internal rhyming & an oxymoron would work well with this topic because I felt that it made the message feel unclear and confusing just like the internet.</p>
